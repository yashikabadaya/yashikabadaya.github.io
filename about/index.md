Hi there, I’m Yashika! I’m a software engineer based in India. My interests lies in distributed system, networking, linux kernel   and exploring more. Apart from tech, you’d find myself figuring out the areas of self-finance and mental health. I really enjoy bringing new ideas to fruition, travelling, reading and writing. 
If you have any questions or just want to chat, you can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YashikaBadaya) or shoot me an [email](yashikabadaya@gmail.com).
